This is a data set about semi-supervised learning method for strip defect detection, in which the defects in labeled images need to be labeled by themselves, while those in unlabeled images need not be labeled. The data set can be used for training and testing of strip defect semi-supervised learning method.

Some of the data provided by  may require users to perform data augmentation operations ( original data set expansion ) according to different task assignments to prevent underfitting or overfitting in different physical models.
